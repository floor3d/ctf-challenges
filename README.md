# NEU CTF Challenges
These are challenges that I have made for Northeastern's CTF Club, specifically for competitions
that we have hosted. In each challenge is its description as well as write-up. 
<br />
I hope that this can be a good source for learning some simple CTF tactics as well as a trove of 
ideas for those looking to make CTF challenges themselves.
