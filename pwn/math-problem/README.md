### Description
I'm trying to finish my math problems, but I'm too slow... there must be a better way to do this.

### Build instructions
Run with socat EXEC on remote server (or local) and connect via netcat.

### Flag
CTF{KW1K_M4FS_P0G}

### How to solve
You need to make a script which communicates with the remote server using sockets :)

A good way to start with this is using AI! It's great for boilerplate to build functionality
